# hello-world
Just another repository

Hey there Github,

I'm a Skillcrush.com "Front End Development" student and I'm about to code my first website. I already have a self-hosted website on Wordpress that I've made lots of updates to but never in the CSS Editor. Coding seems to come naturally to me and I love the work that I'm doing. Everything I've learned so far has been incredibly interesting and fun!
